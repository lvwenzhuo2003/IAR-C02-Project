# IAR-C02-Project
IAR online group final project


##Background


Today, though the clear data is unknown, about 8,000,000 people are missing every year in China. Among them, there are more than 200,000 children and 200,000 old people. Even worse, some women and children are trafficked into the hard labor and sex industry. The loss of population has become a serious problem. China has made a lot of effort to deal with this problem, but the results are not so good. The main reason for the situation is that the complex flow of population and lack of an effective way to locate and track the missing makes it difficult for the police to save them. Our team, being aware of the problem, plans to develop a positioning system to help save more missing people. With the large missing population, it will have a widespread commercial value and prospects for development. 


##Previous related network


Lora: it is indeed perfect for single-building applications and it has a longer time. However, its lower data rates are extremely lower, and it has a longer latency time. These drawbacks will affect the efficiency of work when we are using this network. Because of the long latency time, it takes us more time to wait for the network response.

Sigfox: the advantages of it are very obvious: it consumes a lower amount of energy and it can support a wider coverage area. Nevertheless, because it sends very small amounts of data very slowly, the size of files that it can transmit is limited. Moreover, Sigfox devices have difficulty to move. And also, its capacity from the base station back to the endpoint is constrained, therefore the link budget will go up rapidly. 


##Technology


There are three basic technologies that we will utilize this time: NB IoT, GPS, and blockchain. NB IoT, also called Narrowband IoT, is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) radio technology standard developed by 3GPP. NB IoT is developed to save power efficiently when it is not operating. Comparing with other technology like LTE-M1, NB IoT has a better ability to provide connectivity. For now, this technology is widely used in different areas. The second technology is common but useful which is GPS. GPS enables the system to follow a specific person. The last one is the blockchain, and it is known by more people in recent years. Simply blockchain can be defined as a distributed database existing on different computers at the same time. There is a primary difference between a blockchain and a database that is centralization. Security, transparency, and high reliability are all the advantages of the blockchain.
